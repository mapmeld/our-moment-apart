### Our Moment Apart: Intro

I’m excited to share something new. I combined some short fiction stories into a book "Our Moment Apart"
which you can read free here (or purchase for Kindle).

Over the past few years, I would browse bookstores and realize I was looking for a few specific stories,
but they didn't exist yet, and I would have to write them.
Most of these stories are sci-fi  — they range from 1,400 to 15,000 words, with the longer ones delving into more realistic plots with AIs, quantum computers, and blockchains. This title "Our Moment Apart" reframes our present society as a temporary break where people and technology co-exist separately. To be honest, one story I’m rushing to post because it could come true any day now.
