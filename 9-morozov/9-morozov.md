---

### SCENE ONE: THE APARTMENT

*Daybreak in a messy corner apartment. Our protagonist, Nick, is brushing his teeth and refreshing the traffic analytics on a computer screen.*

**NICK**

[counting] mm mm hmm, mm mm hmm mm

*Nick clicks a link to a YouTube podcast, which starts auto-playing.*

**PODCAST GUY**

And this is one of the funniest things that I’ve seen, it’s a web site where to access anything you have to write commands...

**PODCAST GUY 2**

Yeah…

**PODCAST GUY**

...in Fortran.

**PODCAST GUY 2**

Sorry, uh… what the fuck?

*boing sound effect*

**PODCAST GUY**

So everyone is trying to look up how to write Fortran and get through the puzzle to the end.

*Nick goes into the bathroom and returns washing his face.*

**PODCAST GUY 2**

But aren’t all Fortran coders from like thirty, fifty years ago? Ain’t nobody got time for that. My grandpa is going to win this puzzle before-

*Nick stops the video, packs the laptop into his bag, and leaves.*

*MONTAGE shows Nick biking onto a college campus, sitting in class checking Twitter for more traffic, getting hungry and going alone to a diner for lunch.*

### SCENE TWO: BURGER PLACE

*At the counter of a busy 50s-diner-themed restaurant, Nick is idly watching statistics on his phone. The server places a macaroni-and-cheeseburger in front of him.*

**NICK**

Thanks, that looks good.

*STRANGE DUDE and STRANGE WOMAN sit at the counter on either side of him.*

**STRANGE DUDE**

Hey, what’s that you’re having?

**NICK**

It’s a macaroni-and-cheeseburger, like a cheeseburger but the topping is macaroni and cheese.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

I’m going to be honest: that sounds disgusting.

**NICK**

It is, but at the same time, it is so good.

*Nick deliberately takes a big bite to show how he enjoys the burger.*

**STRANGE DUDE**

I am totally going to order this.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

I can’t… okay. I won’t talk to you, though.

**NICK**

Do you know each other? I mean, if I’m in the way..?

*Nick looks to either side to see that there is plenty of space, and Strange Dude and Strange Woman are staring at him.*

Never mind?

**STRANGE DUDE**

Nick, we were wondering if you could answer some questions about your code.

**NICK**

What? Oh weird. I mean, I would be happy to, but I’m eating. Why didn’t you contact me at work?

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Universities have all these policies about these things.

**NICK**

What kind of things?

*Strange Man and Strange Woman shrug*

**STRANGE WOMAN**

I guess, recruitment?

**NICK**

This research program goes for another year but after that, I can talk about-

**STRANGE DUDE**

It’s more like... national security stuff?

**NICK**

You guys are so confused, I am studying game development now.

**STRANGE DUDE**

We’re not interested in the game development thing. It’s about the Fortran site.

**NICK**

I can’t really talk about that! It’s a competition. I can’t give away the answers! Come on, guys.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Oh, okay, funny little competition.

**NICK**

Mmm yeah.

*A waiter arrives.*

**STRANGE DUDE**

A macaroni and cheeseburger for me and the lady.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

I would prefer to have a Denver omelette.

**WAITER**

Got it.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

So have you noticed if people are using the site?

**NICK**

Well yes, sort of a lot.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Suppose someone in Los Alamos saw your site, and had some questions.

**NICK**

Los Alamos, like the town?

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Los Alamos, like the nuclear research program.

**NICK**

Listen, one of the main reasons that I got into game development is that I didn’t want to make something that would end up killing someone. No recruitment.

**STRANGE DUDE**

Nuclear research doesn’t kill people.

*Nick looks confused, and looks to the Strange Woman, who also looks confused.*

I mean, if your research ever did come to kill people, the world would already be fucked. It’s not like you’re going up to someone and *pop*.

*Strange Dude mimes shooting someone*

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Not the time, Carl.

**NICK**

Yeah I don’t get that.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

So have you been in contact with anyone at Los Alamos about your project?

**NICK**

What? This is the first that I heard about it. I didn’t realize that you guys, your team would still use Fortran. I mean… I get it. But it’s also a real mess. Super old.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

But we don’t work at Los Alamos.

**NICK**

Oh… rightttttt

**STRANGE DUDE**

No, really, we don’t.

**NICK**

What is this all about then?

**STRANGE WOMAN**

You’re about to get served some papers.

**STRANGE DUDE**

Something really serious.

**NICK**

Served… papers?

**STRANGE DUDE**

Some legal stuff that will not be fun.

**NICK**

Does someone own Fortran? Am I not allowed to have a website Fortran-dot-io anymore? I can give it back but I should get my fifty bucks back, too.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Nope, Espionage Act.

**STRANGE DUDE**

You are so fucked.

**NICK**

What?

**STRANGE DUDE**

You’ll want to call us later.

*hands Nick a card with only a phone number on it*

*to waiter*

Please can I get my burger to go?

**NICK**

You’re going to tell me about the Espionage Act and then leave?

**STRANGE WOMAN**

I think it’s best if you get the papers first, so that you know to believe us. We’ll keep an eye on you to make sure that you don’t leave the country.

**NICK**

*goes back to his lunch*

Well, I’ll keep an eye on you, too. Or something.

*Strange Dude and Strange Woman leave. Doorbell dings.*

What is wrong with people?

### SCENE THREE: THE APARTMENT ENTRY

*Night time. Nick looks around and cautiously checks his postbox.*

**NICK**

Oh. Nothing.

*We follow him up the stairs and to the door of his apartment, where a box is waiting.*

Oh shit.

### SCENE FOUR: THE LIBRARY

*Nick meets with a law student friend that night. The box is opened and they are looking at the first packet.*

**EMMA**

This all looks very serious.

**NICK**

But they’re fake, right? I mean I don’t understand how they’re planning to get the answers to the puzzle this way, but-

**EMMA**

Forget about the puzzle! Everyone named in this letter is a real lawyer at the Department of Energy. You can call in the morning and double-check it in an instant. Which makes me think, what I need you to do first is: don’t leave the country.

**NICK**

Uh, okay, easy to do.

**EMMA**

And don’t contact anyone at the Department of Energy for any reason.

**NICK**

You just said that we could call them and ask-

**EMMA**

I know! Okay it’s better if I do it... No, wait, I’m not a lawyer yet. Have your lawyer call them.

**NICK**

I have a cousin who finished law school, I think, but he didn’t reply to my message yet. Could be like a My Cousin Vinny situation.

**EMMA**

No, a national security lawyer! You should know this stuff before you talk to anyone!

**NICK**

They came to me!

**EMMA**

Who?

**NICK**

I don’t know, two strange people. Man and a woman.

**EMMA**

They didn’t tell you who they were?

**NICK**

They gave me a card, oh, here it is.

*Nick presents the business card.*

Just a phone number, not a lot there to go on.

**EMMA**

You know who leaves anonymous cards around and knows about national security shit?

**NICK**

Who?

**EMMA**

The FBI? NSA? CIA?  Could be any or all of them. Let’s get you to my professor.

### SCENE FIVE: THE PROFESSOR’S OFFICE

*The professor is looking through the files and sorting them into stacks.*

**EMMA**

-and then he received these documents here.

**PROFESSOR**

Right, right, these documents.

**NICK**

So they don’t really have anything to do with me, do they?

**PROFESSOR**

Before I talk to you about this, I am going to need a payment to establish attorney-client privilege.

**NICK**

I saw this in a TV show once, hold on, I think I have a dollar.

*reaches into pocket*

**PROFESSOR**

No, I will need you to write a check or money order for eight hundred dollars.

**NICK**

Wait, what?

**PROFESSOR**

And I think it will take me a few hours to get through the details and make a strategy with you, so at least twenty-four hundred dollars.

*Nick looks astonished.*

**NICK**

Can you give me a few minutes to see if I can do that?

**PROFESSOR**

Of course.

### SCENE SIX: THE HALL

**NICK**

Twenty-four hundred… shit, how is my cousin not responding yet?

*Nick reviews the Strange Dude’s card.*

They might have something.

*Nick dials the number. A phone rings and Strange Man and Strange Woman burst out of a door across the hall, carrying listening equipment.*

### SCENE SEVEN: THE APARTMENT

**STRANGE WOMAN**

So we did some research and realized that you weren’t involved in sending messages to scientists at Los Alamos. They were finding, downloading, and sharing your code, voluntarily.

(mocking the scientists in a funny voice)

Oh, isn’t this funny, oh take a look at this Fred, let’s run this code on the big mainframe and see what happens.

**STRANGE DUDE**

We realized it might be good to have a chat before the Department of Energy threw you in jail forever.

**NICK**

Forever?

**STRANGE DUDE**

You broke a nuclear testing supercomputer. We almost told the president.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Who knows what could have happened?

**NICK**

What people do with my code is not my fault or liability or something. It’s in the license.

**STRANGE DUDE**

Open source licenses don’t matter when you break something this big.

**NICK**

What are they going to do, sue me for damages? Ask me to fix it..?

**STRANGE WOMAN**

The budget for this whopper supercomputer is itself hella classified, so they would just put you in jail. For espionage. That means no trial. Just SuperMax oatmeal for the rest of your life.

**NICK**

Oh shit.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Could you do it again?

**NICK**

What?

**STRANGE WOMAN**

So, our boss had a conversation with the Secretary of Energy-

**STRANGE DUDE**

-like, the Secretary of Energy for the United States of America-

**STRANGE WOMAN**

And they were wondering if you would do it again.

**NICK**

No, no of course, I’ll stop writing code altogether if that’s what you want. I hate oatmeal.

**STRANGE DUDE**

No, man, they want you to do it again.

**NICK**

I don’t understand. Are you…

*jumps up from chair*

oh my god you want me to break into Los Alamos and…

**STRANGE WOMAN**

No, no, sit back down!  Let me spell it out: the Russians have their own supercomputer. It does some… some not-nice things.

**STRANGE DUDE**

Very bad things.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

We would all sleep a little easier if this computer... stopped working.

**NICK**

But I don’t know anything about their Russians or their computer or… you didn’t even tell me what not-nice things it does?

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Suppose we had a line of code which would make their machine seg-fault.

**NICK**

Well, that would be a start.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

So here’s what we are picturing.

*same mocking voice used for scientists earlier*

Hey Boris, it’s another sunny day in Mother Russia. Check out this funny Fortran program. 

**NICK**

The Russians would run my code, too?

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Well, no. They’re a little more cautious than our scientists.

**STRANGE DUDE**

This is the cool part. You are going to write your code in Russian.

**NICK**

This is why the plan doesn’t work. I don’t know anything about Russia, it will look wrong.

**STRANGE DUDE**

We will bring someone by tomorrow… sort of a… how should I say it? One of our newest Russian agents, who will be your intern advising you about how to let their guard down.  It will be funny, just like your program.

**NICK**

I get a Russian humor intern?

**STRANGE DUDE**

Uh-huh.

**NICK**

This is straight out of a James Bond movie. This is surreal.

*Nick takes a moment to collect himself.*

This is a dumb question but, dude… James Bond… rookie Russian agent..?

**STRANGE DUDE**

Oh, I think you’ll be great together. Bring some chocolates to our next meeting.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Carl!

**NICK**

*beaming*

I will.

### SCENE EIGHT: THE SAFE HOUSE

*Knocking on the door. The door electronically unlocks and Nick walks in from the street, carrying a blue shopping bag. Inside is a box of chocolates.*

**NICK**

Hello? Anyone home?

**STRANGE WOMAN**

We’ll be down in just a minute. Please take a seat at the table.

*Nick sits at the table. After a few seconds, he takes out a fidget spinner and plays with it.*

*Strange Dude and Strange Woman come downstairs.*

Thanks for coming to meet with us and your new partner. I understand this may be stressful and you may need some time to get to know each other.

**NICK**

Mhmm, sounds good.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Did you actually bring chocolates?

**STRANGE DUDE**

Oh my god, he did.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Can you not do this, Carl? Okay, our partner should be with us in a few seconds.

*There is light treading on steps, then a door opens. MOROZOV, an aging man resembling Sergey Kislyak, staggers through the door.*

**STRANGE DUDE**

So nice of you to join us!  Have a seat.

**MOROZOV**

Ehhh okay… Just a moment while I find the chair.

**STRANGE DUDE**

Any seat is fine… any seat.

**NICK**

Excuse me, are you serious?

**MOROZOV**

No, I am a joke intern. Get it?

*mumbling*

Oh… still so funny. Still so funny.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Look, Carl was just being a dick. Mr. Morozov has agreed to work with us on this project, and we are all appreciating that he would do that for us.

**NICK**

Thanks a lot, Carl.

**STRANGE DUDE**

Muzzie, he has chocolates.

**MOROZOV**

You have chocolates?

*Nick winces and hands over the bag. Morozov sits.*

**STRANGE DUDE**

The two of you will spend a lot of time together to plan this operation.

**NICK**

Is he the right guy for this? I mean don’t you have someone I might gel with a little better? Carl, my man…

**STRANGE WOMAN**

We know that Mr. Morozov is the man for the job. He was always deep in the KGB, but he was also a little special… he was also their funniest agent.

*Scene starts a flashback to a young but recognizable Morozov in front of a window, snow falling*

Our agency had a trace on every Russian phone line in Berlin-

**NICK**

No no no, hold on. I am a little serious now. I don’t see this guy getting a bunch of scientists rolling.

**STRANGE DUDE**

We could ask him to tell a joke.

**MOROZOV**

My humor is only so good in English.

**STRANGE DUDE**

Let my partner continue the story.

*Flashback continues.*

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Finally, alright. The agency had a trace on every Russian phone line in Berlin. Our friend Morozov is moving some secret documents around to some spies, so we tried to follow his movements. It was impossible. My mentor told us that the translators would be on the floor, laughing.

*Flashback shows translators in hysterics.*

**NICK**

Really.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

Whatever we recorded, no one could tell if he was serious about going to this location or that, or just planting red herrings. Then the agency transferred in their spy, a guy we call Stoneface.

**NICK**

Stoneface.

*Flashback shows a tall, bald, expressionless man looking at a wall of pinned papers and connecting threads.*

**STRANGE DUDE**

I’ve met the guy at a party. I tried my funniest jokes on him. No dice.

**STRANGE WOMAN**

He has that reputation. And month by month, Stoneface unraveled the network, put agents in this guy’s room, and snap!

**MOROZOV**

Ah, yes... snap.

**NICK**

Why aren’t we watching that movie?

**STRANGE DUDE**

Just remember that everything that you hear is classified. Especially Stoneface and Morozov. He may look a little worse for wear, but he was supposed to be dead for five years now.

*They look over to Morozov*

**MOROZOV**

Don’t mess this up for me. I like this.

*eating chocolates*

Oh, and a new fidget spinner!

### SCENE NINE: OFFICE IN SAFE HOUSE

*The two are sitting in front of a three-monitor display in a large, empty office.*

**MOROZOV**

Is this what you do for work? Write prank computer scripts?

**NICK**

Nope. Just a side gig when I’m not in class. How about you?

**MOROZOV**

I never used a computer until after I got captured by your CIA friends.

**NICK**

Sorry about that. I think.

**MOROZOV**

It’s fine. No torture. They just gave me some Disney World tickets. And then the computer, they gave me one. If we Russians capture you, there is no Disney World.

I even get a new iPad for this project. Did you know that?

**NICK**

If you Russians capture me? I didn’t do anything.

**MOROZOV**

You know some American agents and you know me, so soon you will be quite valuable to them. Unfortunately you may be captured or interrogated at any time.

**NICK**

Hello, I am in America, there is no Russian agent coming to scoop me up.

**MOROZOV**

Of course there is. They probably rotated out my old friends, but I assure you that there are quite a few Russians in this city. Kidnapping, home invasion, blackmail, all possible.

**NICK**

You’re serious?

**MOROZOV**

This Carl, and this sexy lady spy, they are such amateurs. Already they should have someone to watch your house and your children.

**NICK**

I just have a little apartment and zero kids.

**MOROZOV**

Then make sure to at least ask these amateur spies for money! Your wife will be happy and when you go into Witness Protection, plenty of time and money for the kids.

**NICK**

No, I am not married either. Witness protection?

**MOROZOV**

Hold on, shut up, shut down the computer. We need to get out of this house.

**NICK**

Are you allowed out of the house?

**MOROZOV**

Of course, I am usually too afraid of the spies. But I will take a grenade for you, my partner.

**NICK**

Take a grenade, like… meaning…

**MOROZOV**

You brought some chocolates, I think it is a kind gesture. We can be friends.


### SCENE TEN: THE INDIAN RESTAURANT

*It’s a busy buffet restaurant. Morozov and Nick enter and the staff recognizes Morozov.*

**MOROZOV**

My nephew.

*Indicating Nick*

**MANAGER**

Nice to meet you!

**NICK**

Yes, thank you!

*As soon as they sit at the table:*

Your nephew?

**MOROZOV**

Spies tell lies, it’s my bad habit. As you can see, this is a buffet restaurant. We can eat immediately.

**NICK**

Hmm.. I am hungry…

**MOROZOV**

Also very unlikely to be killed here. To poison me, a spy would need to take out everyone else here.

*Nick covers his mouth and winces, grossed out.*

Even I am not worth that much paperwork. Nothing to be worried about.

*Nick and Morozov return to eat. Nick’s phone buzzes*

**NICK**

Hold on a sec. I need to take a photo of the food.

**MOROZOV**

Oh really, are you an artist?

**NICK**

No, it’s this woman that I used to work with, she really likes Indian food. She’s going to be so jealous.

**MOROZOV**

Why not invite her over? I will be polite and then when you give me the signal [exaggerated wink] I leave for an important appointment.

**NICK**

I am sure that you’re an excellent wingman, but she is on the other side of the country now.

**MOROZOV**

What is the point of that? I don’t understand you young Americans. And I hear it is the same in Russia now, too. The first thing about relationships is, you must ask the girl out in person. A letter is always lost in the mail. And you are left waiting and waiting.

**NICK**

I don’t know why you are so focused on this.

**MOROZOV**

The letter is in the mail, and you are waiting, and then the CIA comes and moves you away before you get the reply.

**NICK**

Oh my god, is that what happened to you?

**MOROZOV**

Maybe.

**NICK**

I am sure you can see her again. Or she can come over to the US from Russia, once things are more chill.

**MOROZOV**

Ah, she is already in the US. She is married to the man they call “Stoneface”.

**NICK**

Harsh! But now I definitely want to see this made into a movie...

**MOROZOV**

Ah… maybe she did not like my humor.

**NICK**

I don’t understand Russian, so I couldn’t judge. I will use this secret agent money to go visit her, though. If you say so.


### ---PREVIEW OF NEXT EPISODE---

**MOROZOV**

I am telling you, this Anastasia could be a Russian spy! You should find out before it gets too serious.

**NICK**

It wasn’t even a date, it was just us hanging out, alright? We made plans to cook dinner at her place next time, though.

**MOROZOV**

Oh, that is very slick. Have the sexy lady spy check her out to make sure it is not a trap.

**NICK**

Alright...

**MOROZOV**

And not Carl! He would fall for it.

*--at crappy buffet dinner with Anastasia, Morozov wanders in--*

**NICK**

Oh man, what are you doing here?

*hugs and whispers in his ear*

What are you doing here?

**MOROZOV**

I have just one thing to say. 

*Morozov whispers in Russian to Anastasia, who bursts out laughing.*

Ah, so you are Russian, then?

**ANASTASIA**

Oh no, Nebraskan. I went to an exchange program in a Russian city for a summer.

**MOROZOV**

Did you have a Professor Korolev?

**ANASTASIA**

It is such a common name! I might have.

**MOROZOV**

The one that I know, you would remember. He keeps his dog in his bag.

**ANASTASIA**

I don’t know…

**MOROZOV**

And sometimes he is wearing it around the ears like we cannot see it…

*Anastasia bursts out laughing.*

**ANASTASIA**

Oh, oh, excuse me, I need to go to the ladies’ room for a moment.

*She leaves.*

**NICK**

What are you doing?

**MOROZOV**

Hello? She is a confirmed spy. Professor Korolev is notorious at my old school. We must leave before she kills you.
